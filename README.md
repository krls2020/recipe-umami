# Zerops x Umami
[Umami](https://umami.is/) makes it easy to collect, analyze, and understand your web data â€” while maintaining visitor privacy and data ownership. [Zerops](https://zerops.io) makes it easy to deploy Umami.

## Deploy on Zerops
You can either click the deploy button to deploy directly on Zerops, or manually copy the [import yaml](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-unami/blob/main/zerops-project-import.yml) to the import dialog in the Zerops app.

## Recipe features
- **.Unami** app running on a load balanced **Zerops Node.js** service
- Zerops **PostgreSQL 16** service as database
- Utilization of Zerops' built-in **environment variables** system

<br/>

## Production vs. development

Base of the recipe is ready for production, the difference comes down to:

- Use highly available version of the PostgreSQL database (change `mode` from `NON_HA` to `HA` in recipe YAML, `db` service section)
- Use at least two containers for the Node.js service to achieve high reliability and resilience (add `minContainers: 2` in recipe YAML, `umami` service section)

Further things to think about when running more complex, highly available .Net production apps on Zerops:

- Containers are volatile - use Zerops object storage to store your files
- Use Zerops Redis (KeyDB) for caching, storing sessions and pub/sub messaging
- Use more advanced logging lib, such as [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog) or [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)
